Create this Serendipity theme just to remember the old PS3 days. 

Unfortunately the theme was not 100% the same as the serendipity mod, starting with the On/Off Button which is very difficult to do something identical... If anyone wants to try to create something as similar as possible, feel free to edit it. 

As the Stand does not yet have something that automatically "copies" the color of the banner, I created countless other banners in different colors so that whoever uses it can enjoy and customize it to their own taste.
