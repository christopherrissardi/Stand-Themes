# 📌 Stand Themes - All Created By Me

Repository dedicated to placing my [Stand](https://stand.sh/) mod Themes. All themes in the repository are my own and were all created 100% by me. I will update the repository over time as more themes are created.

If you want to use the Stand mod themes present in this repository, I will leave an explanation below on how to place them

## 📋 How to Install Themes


1. Clone this repository repository by clicking on `<> Code` and download the ZIP repository
2. Extract the ZIP repository using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=9) or some other file decompressor of your choice
3. choose which theme you want to use and enter the folder. You will see 3 necessary folders: `Headers`, `Profiles` and `Theme`
4. Copy the 3 folders to the Stand folder. Generally, the default folder in your stand is the following: `C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\Stand`
5. Replace everything you order and you're good to go.
6. Enter your GTA V, inject your Stand and go to settings and load the profile that appears

**⚠️ (Remember to take a backup of your old theme if you don't want to lose it!!!)**

🎯 If you want to go back to your old theme, just copy the 3 folders you backed up again and paste them into the Stand folder and change the Mod settings!

I don't usually create many themes, but whenever I do I will update it here in the repository. 👆
