# Serendipity Stand Theme

Create this Serendipity theme just to remember the old PS3 days. For me it was the best mod menu ever created!

For those who don't know the subject and have just arrived in this mod menu universe, I leave below an image of Serendipity from that time..

## About the Theme

Unfortunately the theme was not 100% the same as the serendipity mod, starting with the On/Off Button which is very difficult to do something identical... If anyone wants to try to create something as similar as possible, feel free to edit it. 

As the Stand does not yet have something that automatically "copies" the color of the banner, I created countless other banners in different colors so that whoever uses it can enjoy and customize it to their own taste.
